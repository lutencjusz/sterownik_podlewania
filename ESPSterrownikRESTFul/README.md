# Installation of watering controller [(->PL)](https://github.com/lutencjusz/sterownik_podlewania/blob/master/ESPSterrownikRESTFul/READMEpl.md)
## Preliminary preparation of ESP8266
1. to prepare firmware I used the [NodeMCU custom builds](https://nodemcu-build.com/). For the willing, you can prepare the right firmware yourself, but it should consist of the following modules (the list of modules is available in the moduly_kompilacji.txt):
```
adc,crypto,encoder,file,gdbstub,gpio,http,net,node,ow,rtcfifo,rtcmem,rtctime,sjson,sntp,tmr,uart,websocket,wifi,tls
```
- it is abslolutly necessary to select the option `LFS options (for master & dev branches)` and select the values depending on the used chip (eg for ESP-12E - all maximum). Due to the limited size of the system's RAM memory, it is necessary to keep all possible modules and functions in the LFS memory as a binary file and from there run them.
- additionally, you must select `ssl = true`, which allows you to add the `tls` module.

2. Prepared versions of the firmware will be sent by e-mail, however, only the version supporting the variable integer can be used, e.g.
```
nodemcu-master-18-modules-2017-02-19-13-15-55-integer.bin - tylko ta jest do wykorzystania
nodemcu-master-18-modules-2017-02-19-13-15-55-float.bin
```
because the `... float.bin` version does not allow you to enter the generated` ESPCSensorRetFul.img` image into the LFS memory.

## Software installation
The installation of software is done using [ESPlorer] (https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/) and requires the use of the ESP8266 class device with at least 40 KB of RAM allocated for the instruction and an additional small space for operating and configuration files.
1. The entire catalog [ESPProviderRESTFul](https://github.com/lutencjusz/sterownik_podlewania/edit/master/ESPSterownikRESTFul/) should be unpacked in a separate directory (eg C:\programs\watering\).
2. Using button *Uload* you should upload the file which is a binary image of the lua modules `ESPSterownikRESTFul.img`
3. In the command line of the ESPlorer you must run
```
node.flashreload("ESPSterownikRESTFul.img")
```
After that the ESP8266 will be restarted, which completes the uploading of the image. Many errors are caused by the fact that there are unnecessary files and programs in the controller's memory, so it is best to delete 'init.lua' file and restart controller before upload the image to its memory.
It is certainly possible to generate your own images that even support float firmware, but the software is adapted to work on variable integers, even for numbers requiring fractional parts.

## Preparation of own versions of binary images by using A Lua Cross-Compile Web Service
As the project is still being developed, it is possible that the version of the development and distribution images will not be adjusted. In this case, it is possible to generate your own image consisting of attached files `.lua':
1. compress `.lua` files (except` init.lua`) to the form 'image.zip'
2. run the tool from Terry Ellison's blog [A Lua Cross-Compile Web Service] (https://blog.ellisons.org.uk/article/nodemcu/a-lua-cross-compile-web-service/) and load the file `image.zip` to the tool via the button *Select file*. 
3. Select the option `REMOTE LUAC.CROSS.INIT (MASTER)`, which will generate file `image.img` and save it.
4. Using the button *Uload* you need to upload the file which is a binary image of the lua modules `image.img` to the watering controller.
5. In the command line of the ESPlorer you must run
```
node.flashreload("image.img")
```
After that the ESP8266 will be restarted, which completes the uploading of the image.

4. Additionally, the following files must be loaded to the driver:
- ustawieniaZ.json
- parametryCz.json
- log.json
- kalendarz.json
- init.lua

5. After reboot, ESP8266 is ready to insert into the target electronic board. Please note that the housing of the controller should be waterproof. The system practically does not heat, so it does not require additional cooling. I have not tested the system in winter conditions...

# Watering controller development
In the next version I intend to introduce the possibility of determining the probability of watering the plants in the future by the controller, which involves the need to plan water replenishment in the tank, in the case of holidays or longer absence.

I am also considering the possibility of changing to the ESP32 platform (MicroPython language) due to memory constraints of the ESP8266 module when downloading weather information from external websites (RESTFul API).

I plan to create a Grafan panel that works with InfluxDB to perform more complex statistics that can improve the logic of the module.

# Modules of controller
The software of watering controller consists of the following modules:
-   `init.lua` - starter module, that iniciate boot process,
-   `bootowanie.lua` - module for booting and maintaining the controller,
-	`_init.lua` - module for loading other modules,
-	`httpServer.lua` - library for mini server HTTP created by @yulincoder i @wangzexi https://github.com/wangzexi/NodeMCU-HTTP-Server,
-	`InfluxDB.lua` - module that records data from the controller in the real-time database,
-	`kalendarz.lua` - module supporting dates and times and their comparison
-	`logika.lua` - module of the controller's logic,
-	`parametyZewnÄ™trzne.lua` - module that downloads weather data from the web service airly.eu.
-	`pliki.lua` - module supporting operations on external files (JSON),
-	`ServerWWW.lua` - module supporting the RESTFul API service of controller,
-	`Vc.lua` - module support metering of supply voltage,
-	`WiFi.lua` - module connecting the controller to the local WiFi network,
-	`wyslijMejl.lua` - module executing the sequence of sending mail

## `init.lua`
I have separated the module to simplify development. it is the only module directly in RAM. Manages the settings of two variables:
- `debugowanie` *(true/false)* - true means that during the module startup and operation the log console will display additional information from modules,
- `zapisDoInfluxDB` *(true/false)* - 
true means that the InfluxDB module will send parameters to the real-time database (use the timer function `zapiszPTestoweInfluxDB()`).
Runs the `bootowanie` module in LFS memory by command:
```
pcall(function()node.flashindex("bootowanie")()end)
```
and gives him control.

## `botowanie.lua`
First, the module cleans out unnecessary files with the `.lua` end, with the exception of` init.lua`, in order to delete unnecessary files created during developing.
```
l = file.list();
for k,v in pairs(l) do
    if string.find(k, ".lua")~=nil and string.find(k, "init.lua")==nil then 
        if file.exists(k) then
            file.remove(k)
            print("  usunieto " .. k .. " ...")
        end
    end
end
l=nil; k=nil; v=nil; s=nil
collectgarbage() 
```
### Loading modules and setting pre-values of variables

Then it reads the settings file `ustawieniaZ.json`, writes to the object` u` and assigns the object to variables.
Another function `do_next` is responsible for the course of the boot process and is divided into three major groups:
1. Loading of modules:
    - Vc,
    - pliki,
    - WiFi - the module expects to synchronize the clock and the variable setting `czyZsynchonizowano = true`

2. reads the `parametryZewn` module and retrieves weather data by `pobierzDanePowietrza()` and sets the global variable `dataOstatniegoZapisu` giving the current time as a string in the format 'day/month/year hour:minute:second'.
It tries to download data from the external service three times and if it fails, it reboots the controller.

3. loading the `_init.lua` module that loads additional modules:
    - `httpServer.lua`
    - `kalendarz.lua`
    - `logika.lua`
    - `wyslijMail.lua`
    - `InfluxDB.lua` - conditionally, if the variable `zapisDoInfluxDB` is *true*, which is set in 'init.lua'
    - `ServerWWW.lua` - which runs the RESTFul API
Then it loads the values from the service through the function `odswierzZakresyCzujnikow()`. Finally, he runs the function `obslugaModulu()`, which is the main loop of the controller.

### main loop of the controller

Main loop of the controller is carried out by the function `obslugaModulu()`, which is divided into three commands groups:
1. This block of instructions checks data of last loading weather data that is in variable `dataOstatniegoZapisu` 
if it's been longer than minutes in variable`czasDoOdswierzeniaMax` (eg. 60 min.). Then the weather data from the service airly.eu `pobierzDanePowietrza()` for max. 20 seconds.
If the data has been sukcesfully downloaded, the `wynikPZ` object is refreshed, which is the object of the current weather data used by other modules.

2. In this block the appropriate objects are loaded from JSON files through 'initKalendarza()', which is to prepare the environment to check the possibility of starting the pumps: 
- `tLog` - stores information about pump start-ups 
- `tAlarm` - stores information about alarms related to trial run
- `tKalendarz` - stores information about the beginning of periods in which plants can be watered
Then it attempts to write to the InfluxDB database by `zapiszPTestoweInfluxDB()`, if the variable `zapisDoInfluxDB()` is set.

3. The block starts checking the possibility of watering by activating functionality the decision cell `czyAlerthumidity()`, which sets the global variable `czyUruchomicPompkiKalendarz1`, depending on the humidity.
Next is checking the ability to start the pumps by function `uruchomPompki()` and to load new values of objects from files by `initKalendar ()`, to update the data loaded in block nr 2. To correctly calculate the time until the next runing watering, is taken six attempts to read the log "log.json" are carried out to run the controller and if no data is loaded controller is restarting.

4. The block calculates time to start next check of watering in the command
```
tmr.interval(5, d * 60 * 1000) -- d jest w min.
```
To do this, the `zaIleUruchomicPompkiKalendarz()` function is run, corrected by the time it takes to send a reminder e-mail to fill up the water in the tank that is in varable `ileCzasuDoWyslaniaMejla`.
Then it is checked whether the time has been calculated on earlier then now (<0), if yes, it is corrected by varaible `ileCzasuDoWyslaniaMejla`.
If calculated time is still too early then now or is bigger then posbilities of the ESP8266 (over 113 minutes). Calculated time is set to maximum time and write to global variable `dataNastepnegoSprawdzenia` based on `kiedyNastepneSprawdzenie()` function.

Finally, whole porcess of booting is started by command:
```
tmr.alarm(3,1000,1,do_next)
```

## `logika.lua`
The module provides logic for making watering decisions based on available weather parameters. The module consists of the following decision cells that return the modified `ob` object and set the global variable `czyUruchomicPompkiKalendarz1` by `czyAlerthumidity (ob)`:

### czyAlertPozZasVc (ob)
The decision cell checks the supply voltage pumps (variable `PTestowe.Vc`) is within the designated range specified by the parameters `pCz.VcMin` and` pCz.VcMax`, while blocking the activation of the pumps in the event of value is out of range.

### czyAlertPozZasVp (ob)
The cell does the same as its before one, only for the system voltage specified by `PTestowe.Vp`. The range is specified by `pCz.VpMin` and` pCz.VpMax`.

### czyAlerthumidity (ob)
The decision cell checks the air humidity `PTestowe.humidity` limited by` pCz.humidityMin` and `pCz.humidityMax` to block the activation of push-ups.
Additionally, it sets the global variable `czyUruchomicPompkiKalendarz1` if the humidity is higher than the optimal value that is in variable `pCz.humidityOpt`. if the variable is set to *false*, blocks the morning start of watering.

### czyAlertTempPow (ob)
The decision cell checks the temperature of air `pTestowe.temp/_u`. if it is without the range specified by `pCz.temp_min` and `pCz.temp_max`, blocks the start of watering.

### czyAlertKalenadza (ob)
The decision cell determines the current time in relation to the times set in the calendar as well as the date of the last watering. Checks whether the watering has already taken place or not yet. It blocks the start of watering, if watering at that time has already taken place.

### czyAlertPoziomuWody (ob)
The decision cell checks if there is enough water for watering. if it is not fill, it blocks the start of watering. Currently, the cell is blocked and always allows watering.

### czyAlertPrzedzialuCzasowego (ob)
The cell determines on the basis of the current time whether it is the moment for watering, which fits within the designated time interval. This interval is between the date of the beginning of watering stored in the 'kalendarz.json' file and time determined by the global variable `mozliwyCzasNaPodlewanie` (expressed in hours). The decision cell does not distinguish whether it is watering the morning or evening.
The decision cell for the evaluation uses the external function `czyMiesciSiePrzedzialeCzasowym ()` in module `kalendarz.lua`.

### ustawienieAlertowLogiki (ob)
The function combines individual decision cells and returns the result of the analysis in the form of an `ob` object.
